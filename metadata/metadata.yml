description: "Replication package for 1918 Every Year: Racial Inequality in Infectious
  Mortality, 1906--1942, forthcoming AEA Papers and Proceedings 2022. \n\nIn the first
  half of the 20th century, racial inequality in the rate of death from infectious
  disease was immense. In every year from 1906 to 1920, Black Americans in cities
  died from infectious diseases at a rate higher than that of urban white Americans
  during the 1918 influenza pandemic. We decompose mortality into three broad causes
  of death to determine which causes were most influential. Our results suggest that
  racial inequality in infectious mortality was primarily driven by TB and flu---the
  two major respiratory causes of death. Waterborne causes, by contrast, played a
  minor role in explaining the disparity."
